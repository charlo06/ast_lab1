          p What can you expect from Greendale Community College? We say: EXPECT THE WORLD! Greendale Community College prides itself on its affordable credit hours, manageable campus size, and interesting people. Did you know actor Luis Guzman was once a student here?
          p Founded in 1974, GCC has been a great place for students to acquire the skills they need to enter the workforce and on your budget. Last year we introduced the "No More Than 64" promise, which means you'll never pay more than $64 per credit hour. You'll have to buy a calculator just to add up all the money you'll be saving! With over 80 areas of study, you can explore your interests before deciding on a major. Our academic and career advisors will help you create a plan you can get behind!
          p Not interested in staying at Greendale forever? Community College makes an excellent stepping stone and transferring credits to and from Greendale has never been easier. To aid with your transition away from Greendale, we have developed the "Six Degrees of Preparation" plan to make sure you have skills in the following areas: PHYSICAL, MENTAL, PUBLIC, SWIMMING, BRAIN, and COMPUTER. Greendale is committed to helping you prepare for success.
          p Don't forget our beautiful campus! In the middle of the day there are at least thirty great places to stay in the shade, usually under beautiful trees and awnings. With all this talk about "hedge funds" in the news, we've started our own! By summer 2010 each of our walkways will be flanked by a number of decorative hedges.
          p Did we mention that actor Luis Guzman was once a student here?
          p Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and the beauty of Greendale is that you won't be confronted with either. We want you to feel comfortable and at home on our campus.
          p Come to Greendale, your mind will change, but your life doesn't have to.
